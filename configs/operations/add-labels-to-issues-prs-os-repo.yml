        Given the following text, decide if it is mainly discussing Apache Lucene itself — meaning its APIs,
        versions, features, usage, configuration, or performance — rather than just containing logs, stack
        traces, or incidental mentions of Lucene classes inside another system (like OpenSearch).
        Respond with a single word: "true" if the text is mainly about Apache Lucene itself, or "false"
        otherwise. Do not say anything else.
